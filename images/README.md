## 🔄 Updating Banners

1. Design new images in Photoshop, Canva, Figma, or similar.  
2. Export them in the correct size & format.  
3. Replace the existing `banner1.png`, `banner2.png`, `banner3.png` files.  
4. Keep the **filenames unchanged** (so `index.html` carousel code doesn’t break).

## 🎯 Best Practices

- Always keep **3–5 rotating banners** max to avoid slowing the homepage.  
- Use brand colors (#0f62fe, #2b69ff, #a50034) for consistency.  
- Make sure text is large enough to read on mobile.  
- Save compressed versions (use [tinypng.com](https://tinypng.com) or WebP) to optimize speed.
